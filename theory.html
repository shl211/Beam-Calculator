        <p>The purpose of this section is to provide users with a solid grounding in the theory. This also serves as documentation for the purposes of developing the solver. The sections are organised as follows: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Assumptions</li>
            <li>Singularity Equations</li>
            <li>Maxwell's Equations</li>
            <li>Determinate Beams</li>
            <li>Indeterminate Beams</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <p class="sub-heading">Assumptions</p>

        <p>Engineer's Beam Theory is based on the following assumptions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The beam is initially straight and has a constant cross-section</li>
            <li>Deformations are small compared to the beam length</li>
            <li>Material is isotropic and obeys Hooke's Law</li>
            <li>Shear forces are transmitted through the beam</li>
            <li>Normal stresses are negligible</li>
            <li>Transverse sections remain plane after deformation</li>
            <li>Beams are slender</li>
        </ul>
